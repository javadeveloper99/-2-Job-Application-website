          Job Application Form – Web Project

This project is a Job Application Form designed for web-based recruitment processes. The form is built using HTML and CSS to provide a user-friendly and visually appealing interface for job applicants. It allows users to input their personal details, job role, address, city, and pincode, as well as upload their CV for submission.

The form is structured using div-based layout techniques and organized with a grid-based responsive design to ensure it adapts well to different screen sizes. It includes various input fields such as text inputs, dropdown selection, date picker, and file upload functionality. The design follows modern UI principles, utilizing CSS flexbox and grid for layout management, and applies hover effects and smooth transitions for an enhanced user experience.

Validation features include focused input indicators, making it clear which fields are active. The form’s submit button is styled dynamically, changing colors on hover. Additionally, media queries ensure that the form remains accessible and well-structured on smaller screens.

This project can be extended by adding JavaScript validation and backend integration to process job applications efficiently. It serves as a fundamental building block for modern job application portals, improving the hiring process.
